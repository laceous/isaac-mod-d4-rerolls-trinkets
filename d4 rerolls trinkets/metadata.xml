    <description>By default, the D4 doesn't re-roll held trinkets. This mod corrects that. Slotted and smelted trinkets are both supported. Other items that call the D4 (d100, d infinity, missing no, dice room, reverse wheel of fortune, etc) are also supported.

By default, Tainted Eden re-rolls slotted trinkets when taking damage. This mod adds support for smelted trinkets.

Additional Birthright support for Tainted Eden has been added. After obtaining Birthright, smelted trinkets will no longer be re-rolled.

Mod Config Menu provides some options:
[list]
    [*]Choose which types of trinkets to re-roll (slotted and/or smelted). Tainted Eden will always re-roll slotted trinkets when taking damage.
    [*]Choose how to re-roll golden trinkets (completely random -OR- gold to gold / non-gold to non-gold). Tainted Eden will inherit this option when taking damage.
[/list]
